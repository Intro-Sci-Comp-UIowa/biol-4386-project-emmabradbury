Created the raw_data_extraction.csv which replicates the original cpsc12t01.csv but, is a copy so that I am not editing my original data. I then imported that data into R workspace and corrected the formatting so that labels were not just in columns, eliminated white space, and then amended the data to only include the states and their counts of each type of court which I wrote into a csv and saved into another new file under analysis called courts_by_state.csv. Last, I used the sum function in R to make my own total for each category of specialty courts in the table, turned the totaling vectors into a csv called court_totals.csv, loaded the csv as a data frame into R and then read that data frame as a matrix to plot this bar chart below.
