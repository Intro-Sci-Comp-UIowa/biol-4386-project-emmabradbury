# Overview

This script file contains an R Markdown script for reproducing Figure 1 from this repository dataset.
The goal of this project was to make a script that would describe how to pull the data table based off of the BJS version, make it accessible to just change the types of courts listed or numbers, and run the chunks of script to pull a figre up representing either the new totals or the original ones if unedited. 
This script must be ran or copy and pasted chunk by chunk as ggplot has to create the frame first and layers after.
