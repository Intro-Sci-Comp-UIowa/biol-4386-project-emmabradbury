# Census of Problem-Solving Courts, 2012
In this study, the Bureau of Justice Statistics took a census and compiled data from the US, Puerto Rico, and Guam to analyze problem solving courts. Problem solving courts were defined as courts that aim to treat underlying problems of criminal behavior instead of just punishing the criminal. This idea of alternative restorative justice has been growing in recent years and evolved to be what many in criminal justice hope is the bulk future of our justice system to heal offenders and victims and avoid the socioeconomic costs of traditional incarceration when possible. I will be focusing on reproducing the main model that shows the proportions of different types of problem solving courts.
